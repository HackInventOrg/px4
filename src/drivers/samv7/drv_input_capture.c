/*
 * @file drv_input_capture.c
 *
 * Servo driver supporting input capture connected to STM32 timer blocks.
 *
 * Works with any of the 'generic' or 'advanced' STM32 timers that
 * have input pins.
 *
 * Require an interrupt.
 *
 * The use of thie interface is mutually exclusive with the pwm
 * because the same timers are used and there is a resource contention
 * with the ARR as it sets the pwm rate and in this driver needs to match
 * that of the hrt to back calculate the actual point in time the edge
 * was detected.
 *
 * This  is accomplished by taking the difference between the current
 * count rCNT snapped at the time interrupt and the rCCRx captured on the
 * edge transition. This delta is applied to hrt time and the resulting
 * value is the absolute system time the edge occured.
 *
